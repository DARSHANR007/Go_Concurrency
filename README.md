<h1> Go Concurrency Playground</h1>

<br>


This repository is a learning and experimentation space for understanding concurrency in Go.

The goal is to learn by writing small programs, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly building an intuition for how Go handles concurrent execution.

`Some examples may be simplified, incomplete, or even intentionally imperfect, as the goal is to learn by experimenting rather than to present perfect ready code.`
